## From Rejections to Realization: My GSoC 2025 Journey with Julia and TuringLang

In 2023, I submitted **three proposals** in Google Summer of Code.
None of them got selected for [The Julia Language](./Shravan-Goswami-Julia-GSoC-Proposal.pdf), [Purr Data](./Shravan-Goswami-Purr-Data-GSoC-Proposal.pdf) and [The Tor Project](./Shravan-Goswami-Tor-GSoC-Proposal.pdf)

At the time, it stung. I had invested weeks into those applications, reading documentation, designing ideas, revising again and again. But the rejections werenâ€™t the end of the story â€” they became part of the path.

Two years, a lot of learning, and some incredible mentors later, Iâ€™m incredibly happy to share that Iâ€™ve been selected for **Google Summer of Code 2025** with **The Julia Organization**, contributing to the **TuringLang** ecosystem!

## The Project: Browser-Based Graphical Interface for JuliaBUGS

This summer, Iâ€™ll be working on building a **browser-based graphical interface for JuliaBUGS** â€” a graph-based probabilistic programming system inspired by the classic BUGS language (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling).

**JuliaBUGS** is a modern tool for defining and analyzing Bayesian graphical models in Julia. But like many powerful tools, its hard to learn, use and adapt, my project aims to change that...

### The goal?

To make it easier and more intuitive to:

- Construct probabilistic models graphically
- Edit model structures through a drag-and-drop interface
- Run diagnostics and visualize results from JuliaBUGS workflows â€” all within a browser

By lowering the barrier to entry, we hope to bring the Bayesian modeling to more users, especially those who may not be deeply familiar with the command-line or Julia syntax.

## Why This Means a Lot

This project isnâ€™t just another technical contribution â€” itâ€™s personal.

After **three rejections in 2023**, I seriously questioned whether GSoC was for me. But those setbacks turned out to be essential. They taught me how to communicate ideas more clearly, scope better projects, and most importantly â€” seek feedback and build with others.

I want to thank:

- **[Hong Ge](https://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/hong/)**, for supporting me throughout this journey and encouraging me to keep trying even after those rejections.
- **[Raghvendra Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raghvendrag/)**, who helped me shape my 2023 Julia proposal and believed in my ideas before they had any traction.
- And my mentor for this project, **Xianda Sun**, for offering the opportunity to work on something meaningful within the Julia ecosystem.

## Looking Ahead

Over the next few months, Iâ€™ll be contributing to:

- Web-based graphical editors (possibly using tools like canvas JS libraries)
- JuliaBUGS internals and its model representation
- Designing an interface that helps both beginners and advanced users stay productive and focused

Iâ€™ll be sharing updates throughout the summer â€” from design sketches to development progress â€” and welcome feedback from the community.

## Just Keep Going

If youâ€™re a student or early contributor eyeing GSoC â€” and especially if youâ€™ve faced rejections before â€” I just want to say: **keep going**. Every `no` brings you closer to a `yes`, if you're learning from it.

Iâ€™m looking forward to a hot summer  and cool contributions in open source, learning, collaboration, and building something that hopefully makes a small but meaningful impact.

Thanks for reading â€” and see you around the Julia and TuringLang communities!
