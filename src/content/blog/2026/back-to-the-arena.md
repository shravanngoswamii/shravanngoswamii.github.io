## Introduction

As I enter the final semester of my B.Tech in CSE, it’s strange to think about how every decision, big or small, has brought me to where I started. It’s January 2026, and along the way, I’ve achieved some amazing milestones in Open Source and Research. However, there is one chapter I left unfinished: Competitive Programming.

## The Beginning: Eager but Unfocused

Like many CS undergrads, I tried DSA and CP during my first year. I was eager, but I wasn't consistent. To be honest, I wasn’t particularly good at it either. My approach to learning wasn’t great—I relied too much on AI for answers, which didn’t help develop my problem-solving skills. Over time, I lost interest in CP because I felt like I wasn’t actually learning anything.

## Finding My Path: The Open Source Journey

While CP didn’t click for me, I turned to Open Source and quickly found my niche. I didn’t fully understand it at first, but I was enjoying the process. It took me months just to set up the development environment for a basic project, Documenter.jl. Still, I kept going and started contributing to the project within the Julia Language ecosystem, hoping to be selected for Google Summer of Code (GSoC).

It wasn’t a smooth journey. I applied for GSoC in my second year (2023) and was rejected. But I didn’t let that stop me. I kept contributing, learning, and engaging with the community.

## Career Highlights: Open Source, Cambridge, and NTRO

My persistence in Open Source eventually paid off in ways I hadn't imagined:

- **Research Assistant at Machine Learning Group, University of Cambridge**: In May 2024, I received an offer to contribute to the [**Turing.jl**](https://turinglang.org) ecosystem, a role I’m still continuing in 2026.
- **GSoC 2025**: After the initial rejection, I finally made it! I was selected for GSoC 2025 with the Julia Language.
- **Smart India Hackathon & NTRO**: I reached the finals of the Smart India Hackathon, which led to a Cyber Security Intern role at the **National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO)**.

In the midst of all these achievements, I left competitive programming almost entirely. I still participated occasionally and even reached Pupil (1247 rating) on Codeforces, but it was never my primary focus.

## 2026: Back to the Arena

Now, in 2026, I’ve decided it’s time to open that chapter again.

Why now? Maybe it’s the desire to improve my problem-solving skills before graduation, or perhaps it’s simply the thrill of conquering something that once felt out of reach. With the discipline I’ve gained through research and open-source development, I feel ready to approach algorithms with a fresh perspective.

This blog will serve as a log of my renewed journey into Competitive Programming. From Open Source to Algorithms, the circle is now complete.

See you on the leaderboard!
